Every since my first website back in 2003 (!) I have never been satisfied with my web projects.  There is always something to change, add, or reconsider.

This is a list of the things I'd like to explore for this site.  Much like the site itself, this list is ever-changing.

## Publishing
- [] Post type: Bookmark  
- [] Post type: Scrobble (music listening)
- [] Post type: Movement (GPS log)  
- [] Conversion of previous Hugo site to Work category

## Site
- [] Light/dark switch
- [] Web font integration
  - Emojis
  - Checkboxes
  - Pretty
- [] Home page filtering
- [] Style guide (https://www.zachleat.com/web/now-with-style-guide/)
- [] Webmentions
