title: 'Social Silos and The Internet' 
summary: 'Laying the groundwork for a tried-and-true approach to the next iteration of our social web'

## The world is changing, again

[Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) is broken.  Since the dawn of social media, users have been trained to contribute and consume content owned by [silos](https://indieweb.org/silo) of algorithmic interactions.  The value of a silo lies in the sense of belonging and connectivity it provides. 

While this model was effective in encouraging our least tech-savvy individuals (hi, Mom!) to get used to digital interactions, it has become troublesome.  The degree to which the companies running our social networks abuse our trust and our data has become increasingly obvious.

## You're not the customer; you're the product being sold

I used to use this quote as a joke - something to remind myself of the invisible cost of social networking.  It was always a truism, but back when Web 2.0 started, the "customers" in that relationship were a relatively small, vaguely trustworthy group of advertisers and early collectors of "big" data.  

Now, in 2019, the customers of society's data output has become diluted and frightening.  Our data is being used against us for political, financial, and world-threatening purposes.  The scariest part is that the data harvest has become so ingrained in our daily life that it seems impossible to escape.

## Rejecting the silos

Thankfully, escape is possible and was available all along.

It's too early to call anything Web 3.0, but it isn't too late to course-correct Web 2.0 towards a better future.  The interaction model we have with large social silos needs to be redirected to **healthier, smaller, and decentralized social networks of people we actually know**.  

This method of networking individuals exists today, known as The Internet.  The Internet's original purpose was to enable this exact form of social interaction: individuals creating content for other individuals, and consuming content from trusted sources.  We can reawaken this original intent and improve on it with the technology and knowledge we've gained since the Web began.

Anything worth doing is worth doing right, and as such this change in social behavior will not happen overnight.  It will require foresight and planning, as well as intriguing incentives.   This should come as no surprise, as each iteration of the Web required the same things, but now we have the benefit of hindsight.

## OK, so now what?

Every revolution starts by inciting the spirit of the individual.  I have been invigorated by the concepts I've laid out here and want to do everything I can to push them forward.  This post is just the beginning, and I intend to use it as a foundation of things to come. 

We have the collective power to make the Web a better place.  All it will take is realizing what we've become, talking about what we want to be, and making that ideal a reality.  Let's start talking.
