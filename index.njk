        Hi there!  I'm Alex Marcus.  This site is a collection of writing and media which cronicle the things I've done and want to do.  It's partially an experiment in documenting my personal history (I love nostalgia), and partially a resource for you to get to know me.

        Please let me know if you have any questions, thoughts, or comments via email at <a href="mailto:mr@alexmarc.us">mr@alexmarc.us</a>.
